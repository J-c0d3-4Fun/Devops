### Welcome to my simple webpage!

I was given a task to make a simple page using HTML, CSS, and/or javascript that displays “Hello BeyondMD!“, and then dockerize it. It must run using docker compose, and it must run on your localhost.

### First we must break down the request
- The webpage will be hosted using an NGINX Docker container
- I'm familiar with HTML and CSS so I use this to write my code and create my webpage
- Docker Compose is a way to automate the creation of the container using a Dockerfile
- The most recent version of Docker will need to be installed locally
- I will need to expose a port from my local machine to the container
